= Propiska/Internal Immigration Reform

As things stand, the Soviet Unionâ€™s internal passport system (propiska) strictly regulates
where citizens can live and work. Moving to major cities requires official approval, for instance, a policy
which limits labour mobility. The aim is to keep places like Moscow, Leningrad and other urban centres
from overcrowding.

Now, as we aim to jumpstart economic development and liberalization, reformers argue that this system is
in dire need of reworking. They say that workers should be free to relocate for jobs, allowing key
industries to fill vacancies with ease. Hardliners, on the other hand,warn that chaotic migration will lead
to housing shortages, crime, and urban instability.

What is to be done about the propiska system?

@abolish_system
title: Abolish the Propiska System
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 3; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval -= 3; popular_approval += 3; budget -= 2; separatism += 1

We dismantle the internal passport system and allow full freedom of movement across the USSR. Reformers hail it as a needed move toward economic development and liberalization, but cities quickly overcrowd, straining social services and housing.

@allow_in_select_republics
title: Allow Migration Reform in Select Republics
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 2; hardliner_approval -= 2; popular_approval += 1; budget -= 1

We begin slowly, lifting migration control in low population regions such as Siberia. This helps them avoid immediate urban overcrowding, but does little to appease reformers pushing for more freedom of movement.

@maintain_system
title: Maintain the Propiska System
on-arrival: reformer_approval -= 3; hardliner_approval += 3; popular_approval -= 2

We reaffirm the necessity of the internal passport system and the population stability it
brings. This pleases hardliners, but reformers criticize the system as a relic of burdensome Stalinist
bureaucracies.

@loosen_restrictions
title: Loosen Propiska Restrictions for Key Industries
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 2; hardliner_approval -= 1; popular_approval += 2; budget += 2

We ease restrictions on internal movement, allowing migration only for workers in key
industries like construction and energy. This helps bolster critical sectors while keeping urban
populations under control.
