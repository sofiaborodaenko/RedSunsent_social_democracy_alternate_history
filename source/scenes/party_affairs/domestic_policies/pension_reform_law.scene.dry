= Pension Reform Law

The Soviet pension system is buckling, now consuming an enormous share of the annual
budget. Payouts are low, but rising life expectancy, economic contraction and inflation are making even
these modest benefits hard to sustain.

The current system is unviable and in need of swift change so as to avoid social unrest. Reformers suggest
raising the retirement age . Hardliners, however warn that any amendment to the status quo is both
political suicide and a betryal of socialist principles.

@raise_retirement_age
title: Raise Retirement Age by Two Years
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval -= 4; popular_approval -= 4; budget += 4

We raise the retirement age by two years, increasing it from 60-62 for men and 55-57 for women. 
Though controversial, and deeply unpopular among the general populace and hardliners, the move significantly reduces the strain on the Soviet budget and signals long term reform.

@tie_with_inflation
title: Tie Pension Payments to Inflation
on-arrival: reformer_approval -= 2; moderate_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval += 2; popular_approval += 4; budget -= 3

We maintain current retirement age but adjust monthly payments depending on the rate
of inflation at the time. Pensioners see immediate relief and are thrilled at the move, as are hardliners.
Economists, however, warn of heightened fiscal pressure.

@keep_as_is
title: Keep the System As-Is
on-arrival: reformer_approval -= 3; moderate_approval -= 2; hardliner_approval += 2; popular_approval -= 3; budget -= 2

We preserve the status quo and no changes are made. This saves us political backlash in
the short term, but discontent among pensioners who are struggling and economists begging for reform
rises.

@expand_benefits
title: Expand Pension Benefits
on-arrival: reformer_approval -= 3; moderate_approval -= 2; hardliner_approval += 1; popular_approval += 4; budget -= 4

We, boldly, raise pension payouts and increase eligibility in rural areas. The move is very
popular, but inflation sours and economistsâ€™ plea for reform reaches a new high.
