= Review funding for the Buran space shuttle program

For more than a decade, the Soviet Union has been working towards developing a capable space shuttle that rivals those seen in the United States. Although it puts a heavy strain on the Soviet budget, it is broadly supported amongst the politburo and cushions the Soviet economy with a million jobs. 

Shall we continue funding the program, or redirect funds into other areas of our economy?

@greatly_increase_budget
title: Greatly increase the budget towards the Buran Program
on-arrival: budget -= 2; reformer_approval +=2; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval += 2

We decide to greatly increase spending towards the Buran Program. Although this will put a significant strain on our budget, it is quite popular with the politburo, and may ensure that the program is completed significantly faster and more successfully.

@moderately_increase_budget
title: Moderately increase the budget towards the Buran Program
on-arrival: budget -= 1; reformer_approval += 1; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval += 1

We decide to somewhat increase spending towards the Buran Program. Although this will put an additional strain on our budget, it is somewhat popular with the politburo, and may ensure that the program is completed slightly faster and more successfully.

@dont_change_budget
title: Do not change the budget towards the Buran Program
on-arrival: hardliner_approval -= 1

We decide to maintain the status quo and keep the same budget towards the Buran Programme. Although no impact on the budget is made, it may alienate some hardliners who perhaps wanted to expand the budget further, viewing the program as potentially important towards the arms race with the West and expanding the nationâ€™s military capabilities in space.

@moderately_reduce_budget
title: Moderately reduce the budget towards the Buran Program
on-arrival: budget += 1; reformer_approval -= 1; moderate_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval -= 2

We decide to somewhat reduce the budget towards the Buran Program. Although this is slightly unpopular with the politburo, at least some small portion of our budget is now freed up and may be used for some investment in other policies and sectors within the Soviet economy.

@greately_reduce_budget
title: Greatly reduce the budget towards the Buran Program
on-arrival: budget += 2; reformer_approval -= 2; moderate_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval -= 3

We decide to greatly reduce the budget towards the Buran Program. Although this is very unpopular with the politburo, at least a significant portion of our budget is now freed up and may be used for investment in other policies and sectors within the Soviet economy.
