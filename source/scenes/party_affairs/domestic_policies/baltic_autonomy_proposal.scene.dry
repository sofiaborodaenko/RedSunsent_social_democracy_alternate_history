= Baltic Cultural Autonomy Proposal

Tension is rising in the Baltics. What initially began as a movement in furtherance of cultural revival has
sharpened into a full display of political defiance, with nations like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
increasingly asserting their constitutional right to self determination. Many political leaders there are even
toying around with the idea of succession. It appears as if decades of language suppression, Russification
and censorship of nationalist dissidents have pushed them to a breaking point.

In response, a group of Communist Party reformers have suggested we recognize the republics as
“culturally sovereign entities” within the USSR as a way to turn down the temperature and let them buy
back into the Soviet project. This would entail grating official status to their languages and symbols all
the while ceding partial governing control over matters like education to local authorities. Full
independence, however, remains off the table.

Proponents believe this move could deescalate the crisis and preserve unity within the
USSR. Critics, however, argue that it will embolden separatists and further destabilize the union.

What should we do?

@recognize_sovereignty
title: Officially Recognize Cultural Sovereignty
on-arrival: budget -= 1; reformer_approval += 3; moderate_approval += 2; hardliner_approval -= 3; popular_approval += 1; separatism += 2

We formally acknowledge the Baltic countries as distinct nations with cultural sovereignty inside the USSR, a move viewed as a soft recognition of their right to succeed. Reformers and separatists laud it as bold but necessary. Hardliners, however, call it a betrayal.

@local_autonomy_not_formal
title: Offer Heightened Local Autonomy Without Formal Recognition
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 2; hardliner_approval -= 2; separatism += 3

We give Baltic authorities increased power over several new policy portfolios (ie, education, language, budgeting) without formally labeling them as culturally sovereign. The move is viewed as an attempt to contain burgeoning nationalist movements, and only mildly satisfies separatists and reformers. Hardliners, however, remain discontent.

@reject_proposal
title: Reject the Proposal and Affirm Policy of Unity
on-arrival: budget -= 2; reformer_approval -= 3; moderate_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval += 3; popular_approval += 3; popular_approval -= 2; separatism += 4

We reject all Baltic calls for cultural sovereignty, instead opting to affirm the indivisibility of the USSR. Party leadership is subsequently directed to denounce Blatic protests as “nationalist provocations” and crackdowns ensue. This satisfies hardliners, but puts off more reform minded individuals. Separatists, however, are further galvanized.
