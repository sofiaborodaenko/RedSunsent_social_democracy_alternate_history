= Allow Exiled Dissidents to Come Home

For decades, the Soviet Union has maintained a policy of exiling high profile critics of the regime, up to
and including intellectuals, writers, religious activists and scientists. Some big names include Aleksandr
Solzehnitsyn, who was expelled in 1974 after exposing the gulag system, and biologist Vladimir
Bukovsky who condemned the USSRâ€™s use of psychiatric abuse. Now, under the banner of Glasnost,
many within the party are reviving calls to allow them to return home.

Letting them back would please ideological reformers as well as send a powerful message to the liberal
west that they take their stated policy of openness seriously. Hardliners, however, warn of old wounds
being reopened and the possibility of social unrest.

Do we bring them home?

@full_return_no_restrictions
title: Full Return Without Restrictions
on-arrival: budget += 2; reformer_approval += 4; moderate_approval += 2; hardliner_approval -= 4; popular_approval += 3; separatism += 2

We permit exiles to return home without placing restrictions on their ability to criticize the regime. Reformers praise the move as being a major step toward cultivating openness. Dissidents and hardliners, however, waste no time criticizing it as being needlessly divisive.

@permit_return_conditions
title: Permit Return, but With Political Conditions
on-arrival: reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 3; hardliner_approval -= 2; popular_approval += 2; separatism += 1

We allow a curated list of dissidents to come home, on the condition that they will not engage in public political activity. Such is a compromise that mildly annoys reform minded politicians as well as the public, who were hoping for more. That said, something is better than nothing.

@maintain_exile
title: Maintain Policy of Exile
on-arrival: budget += 1; reformer_approval -= 4; moderate_approval -= 2; hardliner_approval += 3; popular_approval -= 1

We keep prominent exiles at bay and bar their return home. Reformers denounce the move as a betrayal of Glasnost and the stateâ€™s human rights record remains sour and unchanged. However, hardliners praise the decision as needed to cultivate unity.
