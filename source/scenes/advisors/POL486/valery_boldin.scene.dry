= Valery Boldin

Boldin was a Pravda journalist at the start of Gorbachev’s rule and
Presidential Chief by the end of it. What also raised eyebrows was his secretive
mannerisms, where he would only speak in whispers to others or , more often, not speak
at all. Nonetheless, Boldin was one of Gorbachev’s closest aides to the very end.
