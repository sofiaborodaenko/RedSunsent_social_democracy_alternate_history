= Funding Gosteleradio

A part of implementing openness through glasnost is the revitalization of state-controlled media to reflect values of social liberalization. Our state committee on television and radio, Gosteleradio, is integral to this pursuit. Increasing its funding will contribute to its transformation away from an authoritarian mouthpiece and towards a forum for ideologized discussion. It is up to us to determine if this is a worthy use of our budget resources.

@increase_funding

We have increased funding towards Gosteleradio. This may be a faulty use of our limited resources, but it will ensure an increase in the vibrancy of national discussion.

@keep_same
title: Keep funding the same

We have kept funding the same. Either it is a worthless expenditure, or not something we can pursue at this time.

@decrease_funding
title: Decrease funding towards Gosteleradio
on-arrival:budget += 2; reformer_approval -= 2

Our overall economic situation warrants a diversion away from state media funding. This will undoubtedly ruffle some feathers among reformers, considering the mediaâ€™s importance in advancing glasnost as a movement.
