= Nikolai Ryzhkov

Having been appointed by Gorbachev as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Nikolai Ryzhkov holds the second-most powerful position in the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991, the year when the Union collapsed. He and Gorbachev both knew that a reform was necessary for the old and inefficient economic structure of the country when they were both working under Andropov, the former General secretary of the Communist party of Soviet Union. Under Gorbachev’s leadership, Ryzhkov worked towards bringing the western-style market economy into the country.
