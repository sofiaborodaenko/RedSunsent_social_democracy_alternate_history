= Re Tooling of Existing State Entities

The proposal of a 200 billion ruble state investment throughout the next 5 years is independent to reinvigorate the economy. We expect that within the next five years that this retooling will allow us to match the needs of our consumers and also improve our export capacity. While some nay-sayers suggest there is nowhere to draw these many billions from.

@compromise
title: 100 billion; a compromise
subtitle: Concerns regarding the great expense of these reforms are not unfounded while we must borrow money now for the good of our future we should not be too hasty. 100 billion will provide more than enough of an investment to invigorate our industrial capacity without placing us in an overlycompromised positon.

@risk_future
title: We must risk the future of the Union on such a brazen gamble
subtitle: This investment and its nebulous notions of acceleration are far to risky of a proposition at this time would be far better served in implementing our reforms in a slow and deliberate manner rather than gamble our futures on hundreds of billions of rubles and the word of economists like Ryzhkov.
