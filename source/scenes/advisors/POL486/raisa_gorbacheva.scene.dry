= Raisa Gorbacheva

Gorbachev’s wife and close confidant. Gorbachev trusted his wife the most as an advisor, and both viewed each other as inseparable since becoming a couple. She was a philanthropist, outspoken advocate for women's rights, and known for her elegance and soft-spoken intellectualism.
