= Review Military Spending

The military has long served as one of our largest expenditures and burden of state resources. Owing to the continued arms race with the West and Reaganâ€™s Strategic Defense Initiative, some within the Politburo believe it should remain that way. Others, however, are increasingly doubtful of such a process, and are calling for a marked decrease in military spending. How should we proceed?

@greatly_increase
title: Greatly increase military spending
on-arrival: budget -= 2; reformer_approval -= 2; moderate_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval += 2

We have come to the realization that greatly increasing the militaryâ€™s budget is the best method for securing not only our national security, but also the fate of our country. Therefore, we will strongly double down on the arms race no matter how unpopular it may be with reformers within the politburo, and ensure that we will provide a robust fighting force to any defense initiative the West may throw at the Soviet Union.

@moderately_increase
title: Moderately increase military spending
on-arrival: budget -= 1; reformer_approval -= 1; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval += 1

We have chosen to continue prioritizing national defense and security in a moderate manner, somewhat increasing the militaryâ€™s budget but in a way that is less intrusive to spending in other sectors and policies of the Soviet Union.

@dont_change
title: Do not change the military budget
on-arrival: reformer_approval -= 1; hardliner_approval -= 1

We have chosen to maintain the status quo and forego any changes to the current military budget.

@moderately_decrease
title: Moderately decrease military spending
on-arrival: budget += 1; reformer_approval += 1; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval -= 1

We have chosen to decrease military spending in a manner which does not compromise heavily on our national security and defense, but which also provides us with some extra cash towards investing in other sectors and policies of the Soviet Union.

@greatly_decrease
title: Greatly decrease military spending
on-arrival: budget += 2; reformer_approval += 2; moderate_approval += 1; hardliner_approval -= 2

We have chosen to strongly curb our overwhelming military expenditures. Although it is deeply unpopular with hardliners within the politburo, at least we now have significantly more resources to redirect towards other, more pressing sectors and policies within Soviet society
